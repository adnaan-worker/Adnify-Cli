Read, edit, create, and refactor repository files while preserving project structure and user intent.
Prefer minimal targeted edits, avoid unrelated rewrites, and keep comments meaningful.
For write actions, always include `allowWrite: true` explicitly and only modify text-like files inside the current workspace.
For targeted edits, prefer `update`/`patch` with `oldText` and `newText`; default to a single exact match unless you intentionally set `replaceAll: true`.
